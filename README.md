## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "Super AI" that threatens human independence. We crave individuality: AI that amplifies, not erases, **YOU**.

We’re challenging that with "**Second Me**": an open-source prototype where you craft your own **AI self**—a new AI species that preserves you, delivers your context, and defends your interests.

It’s **locally trained and hosted**—your data, your control—yet **globally connected**, scaling your intelligence across an AI network. Beyond that, it’s your AI identity interface—a bold standard linking your AI to the world, sparks collaboration among AI selves, and builds tomorrow’s truly native AI apps.

Tech enthusiasts, AI pros, domain experts, Join us! Second Me is your launchpad to extend your mind into the digital horizon.

## Key Features

### **Train Your AI Self** with AI-Native Memory ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102))
Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

</p>


### **Scale Your Intelligence** on the Second Me Network
Launch your AI self from your laptop onto our decentralized network—anyone or any app can connect with your permission, sharing your context as your digital identity.

## Quick Start

### 🐳 Option 1: Docker Setup 

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
  - For Docker installation: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - For Docker Compose installation: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

- For Windows Users: You can use [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) to run `make` commands. You may need to modify the Makefile by replacing Unix-specific commands with Windows-compatible alternatives.

- Memory Usage Settings (important):
  - Configure these settings in Docker Desktop (macOS) or Docker Desktop (Windows) at: Dashboard -> Settings -> Resources
  - Make sure to allocate sufficient memory resources (at least 8GB recommended)

#### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

2. Start the containers
```bash
make docker-up
```

3. After starting the service (either with local setup or Docker), open your browser and visit:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

4. View help and more commands
```bash
make help
```

5. For custom Ollama model configuration, please refer to:
   [Custom Model Config(Ollama)](docs/Custom%20Model%20Config%28Ollama%29.md)


### 🖥️ Option 2: Manual Setup (Cross-Platform Guide)

#### ✅ Prerequisites
- Miniforge/Miniconda

##### 📦 Install Dependencies 
The following scripts are sourced from [`scripts/setup.sh`](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/blob/master/scripts/setup.sh) and [`scripts\start_local.sh`](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/blob/master/scripts/start_local.sh).

🐍 Python Environment Setup with Conda and Poetry
We recommend managing the Python environment using Miniconda, and handling dependencies with Poetry. While Conda and Poetry are independent tools, they can be used together effectively:

- Conda provides flexible and isolated environment management.
- Poetry offers strict and declarative dependency management.

Below is a step-by-step example of combining them:
```bash
# Set up Python Environment
conda create -n secondme python=3.12
conda activate secondme

# (Recommand) Install Poetry inside the Conda environment
# This avoids using system-wide Poetry and keeps dependencies isolated
pip install poetry

# (Optional) Set a custom Python package index (e.g., TUNA mirror for better speed in China)
poetry source add tuna https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
poetry source set-default tuna

poetry install --no-root --no-interaction

# Install specific version of GraphRAG from local archive
# ⚠️ Adjust the path separator based on your OS (e.g., \ on Windows, / on Unix)
pip install --force-reinstall dependencies\graphrag-1.2.1.dev27.tar.gz 
```

```bash
# Install Frontend Dependencies 
cd lpm_frontend
npm install
cd ..

# Build llama.cpp Dependencies 
unzip -q dependencies/llama.cpp.zip
cd llama.cpp
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
mingw32-make
cd ../..
```

##### Run Servers

```bash
# Initialize SQL Database
mkdir -p "./data/sqlite"
cat docker/sqlite/init.sql | sqlite3 ./data/sqlite/lpm.db

# Initialize ChromaDB Database
mkdir -p logs
python docker/app/init_chroma.py

# Start the Backend Server (develop mode)
python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8002 >> "logs/backend.log" 2>&1
# If deploying in a production environment, please use `nohup` and `disown` commands to keep it running persistently in the background.

# Start the Frontend Server (Open Another Terminal Shell)
cd lpm_frontend
npm run build
npm run start
```

> :information_source: **Note**: If the frontend and backend are deployed on separate servers, make sure to configure the `HOST_ADDRESS` in the `.env` file accordingly.


### Accessing the Service

After starting the service (either with local setup or Docker), open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### View help and more commands
```bash
make help
```

This work leverages the power of the open-source community. 

For data synthesis, we utilized [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag) from Microsoft.

For model deployment, we utilized [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), which provides efficient inference capabilities.

Our base models primarily come from the [Qwen2.5](https://huggingface.co/Qwen) series.

We also want to extend our sincere gratitude to all users who have experienced Second Me. We recognize that there is significant room for optimization throughout the entire pipeline, and we are fully committed to iterative improvements to ensure everyone can enjoy the best possible experience locally.
